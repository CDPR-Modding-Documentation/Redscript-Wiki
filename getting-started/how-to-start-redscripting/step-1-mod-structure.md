This page will give you an overview about a redfile's structure and how to pick the right one for your use case.

## Classes

In which cases do you need a class? When is it enough to just put functions at the root level?

This section should have a short example for a minimal class. If there are multiple options, they should go in their own section after Functions

## Functions

_Can you even define own functions out of a class? I sure don't know_

if you don't need a class, it's enough to do stuff with functions at the root level of your file. When exactly is that?
