# Troubleshooting

## redscript isn't working

#### 1. Check the log

If you are not sure if it's working or have any other issues, you should look for a log file at 'Cyberpunk 2077\r6\cache\redscript.log'. This log file should end with 'Output successfully saved to ...' if the mods were applied successfully. If the log file isn't there, redscript has not been installed correctly.
